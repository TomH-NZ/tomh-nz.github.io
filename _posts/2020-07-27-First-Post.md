This blog will be used to document what I learn while I'm running through the acceleration phase of MYOB Future Makers Academy.  

I'll be posting twice a week, with each post breaking down what I have learnt about software development during the week.  It will be split between C#, software development, coding practices and general coding knowledge, with the early entries leaning more towards C#.
