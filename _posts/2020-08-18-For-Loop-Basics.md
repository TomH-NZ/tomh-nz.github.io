### Looking at For/For Each Loop basics in C#.

A For loop will run through a block of code while a specified condition evaluates as true.  For example:

![A For Loop example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomH-NZ/tomh-nz.github.io/master/images/ForLoop_Example_001.jpg "Basic For loop example")

The above example will run through the Console.WriteLine code while the value of _i_ is less than 5.  When _i_ reaches 5 it will exit out of the loop and the code execution will stop.


A ForEach loop will execute the code block for each element in a collection, such as an array, a list, etc.  For example:

![A ForEach Loop example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomH-NZ/tomh-nz.github.io/master/images/ForEachLoop_Example_001.jpg "Basic ForEach loop example")

This example will loop through once for each element in the numberArray and print _element_ to screen.
