### Generics in C#!

Generics in C# allow you to create code that defers determining the datatype used until the class or method is instantiated.  For example:

![Example code showing a Generic class being created]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomH-NZ/tomh-nz.github.io/master/images/Generics_Example_001.jpg "Example code showing a Generic class being created")


In the above example the class _GenericList_ has a type of _T_, which means that the data type of the object that is created by _GenericList_ is determined at the time it is created.  In this case _GenericList_ creates two different lists, one of type _int_ and one of type _string_.

This allows the code to be reused multiple times, with a different type being used when the class or method is created.  One benefit of this is that it makes the object type safe, in that it will generate an error if you try to enter data of the wrong type into it at compile time, rather than crashing the software at run time.

With Generics if you want the object to have speific functionality you need to add it to the class constructor when it is created.  For the example _GenericList_ you would need to have a list constructor, an add method as well as a return method.  For example:

![Example code showing a list constructor]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomH-NZ/tomh-nz.github.io/master/images/Generics_Example_002.jpg "Example code showing a list constructor")

The above example contains a list of type _T_ that is created when the class is instantiated, a method for adding data to the list (_Add_) as well as a method for returning the data inside the list when it is called (_ReturnList_).
