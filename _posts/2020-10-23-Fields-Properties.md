### Looking at Fields and Properties in C#

Properties are members of a class that can provide access to private fields in the class through the use of the _{ get; set; }_ accessors.  These control whether the field can be either read from or written to.  If no properties are specified in the code then C# will create a default property in the background for the field to use.
For example:

The above code is an _auto property syntax_ which is generated by most IDE's (Integrate Design Environment) when you create a Property. The _get_ portion of the property indicates that _FirstName_ can be accessed from anywhere, while the _set_ portion indicates that it is possible to set the value of the property.
It is possible to make _FirstName_ effectively read-only by removing the _set;_ portion of the property.  This means that the variable can only be read from and not set.


When you initialise a property it is possible to set it to be something other than the default value.  For example:

![Example code showing how to set a properties value]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomH-NZ/tomh-nz.github.io/master/images/Field_Property_002.jpg "Example code showing how to set a properties value")


The above example allows the _FirstName_ object to access the _firstName_ private string, setting the value when the object is created.  If _Person.firstName_ was printed to screen it would display as _NULL_, however if you set a value for _Person.firstName_ then it would print out that value when you printed to screen.

![Example code printing an object to screen]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomH-NZ/tomh-nz.github.io/master/images/Field_Property_003.jpg "Example code printing an object to screen")


The above command would print "Robert" on the screen as the object _bob.FirstName_ has its value set by the variable.

It is also possible to include logic in the property which will determine the value that is passed when the field is called.  For example:

![Example code showing logic in a property]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomH-NZ/tomh-nz.github.io/master/images/Field_Property_004.jpg "Example code showing logic in a property")


With the above example, if the value of __lasers_ is greater than 4 when _LasersProperty_ is accessed it will return the value of __lasers + 100_.  Likewise if the value of __lasers_ is greater than 6 when it is set, the value will be set to 1, otherwise it will take the value that is assigned.
